# About
ASME is a national organization based on mechanical engineering and its foundations. Here at Cal State LAâ€™s charter club, we provide workshops, competition, and resources for all club members of all majors. We have projects and experiences that provide great talking points on resumes and job applications! This year we will be applying Robotics onto a Rover platform. We plan to compete in the SUAS (Student Unmanned Aerial Systems), where we will be using Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering concepts to build our drone.
